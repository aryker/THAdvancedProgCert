 * This class rotates the robot to the specified angle (in degrees) using a Gyro sensor.
 * It uses a PID controller to accomplish this behavior.
 * 
 * NOTE: Through careful testing, it has been determined that the proportional
 * gain for the PID controller should be set to 0.1, the integral gain should be
 * set to 0.05, and the derivative gain should be set to 0.08.
